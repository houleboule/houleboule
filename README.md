- 👋 Hi, I’m @houleboule

- 👀 I’ve got too many hobbies and interests to list. My biggest side project at the moment is my PetFoodList.org website.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning way too much about the shady world of pet food manufacturing.

- 💞️ If anyone is interested, I would absolutely love for collaborators on my PetFoodList.org site. I could use help with:
  - UI development - my biggest goal is to get away from using Google Forms for data entry and write directly to the database instead
  - Web scraping of manufacturer sites. I'm currently using Octoparse. It's going well, it's just time consuming and I would love to have one or two more people writing and running the scraping jobs. 
  - Manual data entry
  
- 📫 You can message me at Support@PetFoodList.org or FelineDiseaseManagement@gmail.com
